# OpenAreaText
Open Source area codes and locale API for SMS messaging and marketing companies. 

API docs: 

# The Problem 

SMS companies do not have a ground source of truth when it comes to updating area codes, timezones, and other locale data, often storing and updatng this data manually in local files. 

# The Solution 

This open-source programmatic API can fetch real-time locale data. That will be automatically refreshed and updated as time goes on. For now, we are starting with area codes. The result of this is that  companies can spend less time worrying about whether their locale data is updated for messaging and more time shipping impactful features for their customers. 

# Roadmap/Asks (How you can help!)

- Scraping area code data using beautifulsoup off of Allareacodes and/or Wikipedia's NANP page (In progress)
- A fast DB store to read and write new data (In progress)
- Security (rate limiting, validation, etc)
